{"title": "Fake helicopter rescues in Nepal net millions in insurance claims", "content": "An investigation by theCentral Investigation Bureau(CIB) of Nepal Police found evidence that chartered helicopter flights, and in some cases even regular commercial flights, were misrepresented as medical evacuations in order to claim insurance money.\nThe findings were disclosed on Sunday at a press briefing at the CIB office in Lazimpat. The bureau\u2019s chief,  Manoj K.C., an Additional Inspector General of police, informed that the so-called rescues were fabricated.\n\u201cEven charter flights were shown as rescues to obtain insurance payments,\u201d K.C. says. \u201cThese were not genuine rescues but fake ones.\u201d\nInvestigators said regular flights were also falsely labelled as rescue operations, with fabricated rescue schedules and passenger records submitted to support insurance claims.\nAccording to officials, in some cases, multiple tourists travelling on a single charter flight were billed as having been rescued separately and at different times, a practice known as \u201csingle flight, multiple billing.\u201d\nAs per the investigation, trekking tourists returning along the same route after completing their journeys were persuaded to fly back to Kathmandu on chartered helicopters, which were later presented as emergency evacuations.\nThe CIB said it had received multiple complaints in recent years, including one as recently as December 16, 2024, and another on September 28, 2025. The Ministry of Home Affairs also formally requested an investigation into fake rescues earlier this winter.\nAuthorities allege that the scheme involved illegal collusion among trekking and travel companies, helicopter rescue firms, hospitals and tourist guides, primarily targeting foreign trekkers.\nThe CIB is currently investigating fake rescues carried out since 2022.\nAfter conducting a separate investigation over the past two and a half months, including during public holidays, the CIB announced the arrest of six people accused of orchestrating the fraud.\nThose arrested include Jayaram Rimal, owner of Mountain Rescue Service Pvt. Ltd., and its manager, Bibek Pandey, Rabindra Adhikari, owner of Nepal Charter Service, and operations manager Bibek Raj Thapaliya, and Mukti Pandey, owner of Everest Experience and Assistance Pvt. Ltd., along with its manager, Subash K.C.\nAll six are affiliated with three companies that investigators say were involved in at least 317 fake rescues.\nAccording to the CIB, the Mountain Rescue Service reported evacuating 1,248 tourists between 2022 and 2025. Of those, 171 were found to be fraudulent, resulting in insurance claims totalling $10.31 million.\nNepal Charter Service reported 417 rescues, of which 75 were found to be fake, with insurance payouts of approximately $8.23 million.\nEverest Experience and Assistance reported 601 rescues, including 71 fraudulent cases, with insurance claims amounting to $1.15 million.\nIn total, investigators estimate that the three companies obtained $19.69 million through fake rescue claims.\n\u201cThis is preliminary data, and the figures could increase,\u201d a CIB investigation officer says toOnlinekhabar.\nAs fake rescues increased, insurance companies covering foreign trekkers began suspending premium payments, according to CIB officials.\nAt least three insurance companies have completely halted premium payments, citing mounting losses from fraudulent claims. Some claims submitted by rescue companies were also rejected outright.\nThe six suspects are being investigated under multiple provisions of Nepal\u2019s criminal code, including organised crime, forgery, fraud and offences against the state.\nInvestigators said the case falls under Section 51 of the Criminal Code, which prohibits acts detrimental to national interest, as well as Section 249 (fraud), Section 253 (illegal financial gain), and Section 276 (document-related offenses).\nAuthorities allege that fake medical reports and helicopter invoices were forged, fraudulent insurance bills were submitted, and tourists were falsely warned of life-threatening altitude sickness to justify evacuations, damaging Nepal\u2019s international reputation in the process.\nThe case is being treated as an organised crime involving collusion among trekking agencies, hospitals and helicopter companies. Money laundering charges may also apply.\nForeign tourists travelling to Nepal typically purchase insurance before trekking in high-altitude regions. Investigators say travel agencies first verified the tourists\u2019 insurance policies before planning fake rescues.\nOnce in the mountains, guides allegedly exaggerated minor symptoms commonly associated with altitude, pressuring tourists into helicopter evacuations that were medically unnecessary.\nIn many cases, officials said, tourists would recover simply by descending to a lower altitude, yet were still flown to Kathmandu and taken to specific hospitals favoured by the rescue operators.\nRescue companies and hospitals then submitted separate or lump-sum bills to insurance providers.\nWhile the current investigation covers cases since 2022, authorities acknowledged that fake rescues had been reported as early as 2018. However, the lack of documentation has made older cases difficult to prosecute.\nIn 2017, a travel assistance firm reported that nearly 35 percent of rescues were fraudulent. That same year, reports emerged of trekkers being deliberately made ill through food contamination to trigger evacuations and earn commissions.\nA government investigation committee formed in 2018 recommended further police inquiry and led to the introduction of new rescue monitoring guidelines. But officials say the absence of records has hindered retrospective investigations.\nThe CIB warned that fake rescues risk tarnishing Nepal\u2019s international image and could eventually make the country a \u201cno-go destination\u201d for tourists.\nOfficials also cautioned that fraudulent evacuations could delay or obstruct genuine rescue operations, potentially putting lives at risk.", "url": "https://english.onlinekhabar.com/fake-helicopter-rescues-in-nepal.html", "scraped_at": "2026-01-28T16:47:42.029265"}

{"title": "Nepal\u2019s election campaign gains pace but manifestos remain absent", "content": "As the House of Representatives election scheduled for March 5 draws closer, candidates have already begun campaigning. They are meeting voters and conducting door-to-door outreach in their constituencies to seek public support. On digital platforms, too, candidates have been strengthening their presence with the same aim.\nOne critical element, however, is missing: none of the political parties has released a manifesto. A manifesto is among the most important tools in an election, offering voters a clear basis on which to judge candidates and parties. Yet parties appear to be avoiding this essential responsibility.\nAs of this writing, just 36 days remain until the election, but no party has published its manifesto. Candidates are therefore campaigning without clearly articulating their policy priorities or governing vision.\nThe election date was announced six months ago, following the formation of an interim government under Prime Minister Sushila Karki after the Gen Z\u2013led protests of September 8 and 9. Political parties had ample time to prepare and present their manifestos. Their failure to do so has prompted growing public concern.\nPolitical analyst Saugat Gautam says that because all major parties have already selected their prime ministerial candidates, many contenders are focused more on promoting those figures than on communicating their own plans and agendas. As a result, he says, the campaign has become increasingly centred on individuals rather than policies.\n\u201cThe sooner the manifesto is published, the better,\u201d Gautam says toOnlinekhabar. \u201cIf there is a delay, people will have less time to critically assess it.\u201d\nConcerns over the delay have also been voiced on social media. Rakshya Bam, a Gen Z activist, has publicly urged parties to release their manifestos as soon as possible.\n\u201cWe want to read your manifesto,\u201d shewrites. \u201cThe public will vote based on the plans and agendas you intend to implement after becoming parliamentarians. Be accountable to the people and publish your manifesto.\u201d\nOnline criticism has continued to grow, though political parties appear largely unresponsive. Writer Srijana Pokhrelnotedin a recent social media post that more than a dozen candidates contesting the election are her Facebook friends, representing different parties. She said she reviewed each of their profiles but did not find a single candidate who had pinned their party\u2019s manifesto.\nPokhrel also criticised candidates who ask voters to judge them by their records, arguing that such records are often \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d At the same time, she questioned candidates with no political track record, asking whether they expect voters to support them based solely on an introductory video. \u201cThis is an election, not a beauty pageant,\u201d she wrote.\nThe Nepali Congress, for its part, says it is still in the preliminary phase of drafting its manifesto.\n\u201cWe are still at an initial stage and are consulting experts from different sectors,\u201d says Pratap Paudel, political adviser to Gagan Thapa, the party\u2019s president.\nPaudel says the manifesto had not been delayed, adding that election-related activities already underway may have created the perception that its release was overdue. \u201cIn fact, manifestos are usually announced only about a month before the election,\u201d he said. He added that Thapa is currently campaigning in Sarlahi and that a party meeting will decide the date of publication after his return.\nThapa is leading the manifesto drafting process for the Nepali Congress.\nUnlike the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML says it is in the final stage of preparing its manifesto.\n\u201cWe are almost ready to publish it,\u201d says Min Bahadur Shahi, head of the party\u2019s publicity department.\nShahi said a few issues still required internal discussion before the manifesto could be released.\n\u201cWe are trying to publish it as soon as possible,\u201d he added.\nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party has informed that it plans to release its manifesto on February 13.\n\u201cWe are reviewing the draft and compiling suggestions and findings from provincial consultations and field studies,\u201d says Manish Jha, the party\u2019s spokesman.\nThe manifesto is being drafted under the leadership of Swarnim Wagle, the party\u2019s vice chairman. Jha said that because candidate nominations were filed 45 days ahead of the election, compared with 17 days in previous cycles, many people felt the manifesto announcement was overdue.\nKrantishikha Dhital, a central committee member of RSP actively involved in drafting the manifesto, said the party would release practical and achievable pledges rather than grand, unrealistic promises.\n\u201cWe are not preparing impossible or irresponsible declarations. The manifesto is being drafted in a way that directly addresses the concerns of young people,\u201d says Dhital. \u201cWe will come forward soon with proposals that reflect the public\u2019s expectations. Our focus will be on education, health care, employment and capital formation.\u201d\nWith just over five weeks remaining before voters go to the polls, the absence of manifestos has left many unsure how to compare candidates beyond personalities and past affiliations, raising broader questions about accountability and policy-driven debate in the campaign\u2019s final stretch.\nParty leaders also acknowledge that delays in releasing the manifesto could make it more difficult for voters to compare candidates.", "url": "https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepals-election-manifestos-absent.html", "scraped_at": "2026-01-28T16:47:17.405903"}
{"title": "Meet Sharda Kumari Paudel, first female principal of Nepal\u2019s oldest school", "content": "Following an intensely complex political period, Nepal this year appointed its first woman prime minister, a historic milestone. While the appointment of Sushila Karki as the country\u2019s first female prime minister has drawn global attention, another appointment within Nepal has received far less discussion despite its significance.Durbar High School, also known as Bhanu Secondary School, the first school in Nepal, has appointed its first female principal, 172 years after its establishment.\nOn November 20, Sharda Kumari Paudel was appointed principal of Durbar High School. Previously, she had been serving as the school\u2019s acting principal.\nBeing promoted from acting principal to principal, Paudel says she now feels more confident, responsible, and challenged.\nShe was appointed through an open competition among three contenders, in which she was the only female candidate.\nEstablished in 1854, Durbar High School took a long time to appoint a female principal. In this context, Paudel notes that in the past, women rarely entered the teaching profession, and those who did were mostly limited to teaching at the primary level.\n\u201cWomen in the past were confined to family life due to societal structures, which limited the time they could devote to their professional development,\u201d says Paudel. \u201cAs a result, it took a long time for women in almost every sector to reach higher positions, and Durbar High School is no exception.\u201d\nHowever, Paudel considers herself fortunate, as it was her father who inspired her to become a teacher and pursue a career in the profession.\n\u201cMy father always motivated me to serve society, and as a result, I chose to become a teacher,\u201d she says.\nBorn in Syangja in western Nepal, Paudel joined the teaching profession in 2004. Her first posting was at Mahendra Rastriya Secondary School in Baluwatar, where she taught health education for 10 years. In 2014, she joined Durbar High School as a permanent secondary-level teacher, teaching economics.\nIn 2019, she was appointed assistant principal of the school. At that time, Durbar High School had only 71 students. In 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, she was appointed principal with limited responsibilities. Under her leadership, the school began conducting virtual classes. Despite the challenges, the school also focused on strengthening extracurricular activities. It organised a national essay competition on the impact of COVID-19 and established a robotics lab.\nDurbar High School became the first government school in Nepal to introduce robotics classes. Students from the robotics program went on to win several competitions and participate in international events outside Nepal. Meanwhile, the school, severely damaged by the devastating 2015 earthquake, completed its renovation. In collaboration with Kathmandu Metropolitan City, smart boards were also installed in classrooms. After physical classes resumed, the number of students increased to 350.\nAs the quality of education improved, Durbar High School began attracting public attention. Even parents who had been sending their children to private schools started enrolling them at Durbar High School, one of the rarest shifts seen in Nepal\u2019s education sector.\nSimilarly, under Paudel\u2019s leadership, the school\u2019s canteen and security systems improved. Currently, the school has 1,095 students. Managing such a large number of students has become one of Paudel\u2019s major challenges as principal.\nThe challenge is compounded by the fact that Sanskrit Secondary School, which has around 900 students, is also operating within the Durbar High School building.\n\u201cAs two different institutions run in the same building, conflicts sometimes arise among students and teachers, and in such cases I have to be especially sensitive,\u201d says Paudel.\nDue to overcrowding, the school is compelled to run tiffin breaks multiple times, which often causes disturbances. Efforts are underway to address this challenge, she adds.\nWhile the number of students continues to grow each year, the school\u2019s resources remain limited. However, with support from guardians, the school has managed to recruit additional staff.\nTo prevent a shortage of teachers, the school has recently introduced the concept of a \u201cTeachers Bank.\u201d The Teachers Bank serves as a backup pool of teachers. For instance, if a teacher is unable to attend classes for a week or longer, the school can reach out to teachers listed in the Teachers Bank. The school has also publicly advertised this initiative and invited interested individuals to join. As a result, Paudel has received many inquiries and has been personally handling the process.\nPaudel\u2019s tenure as principal will be four years. Speaking toOnlinekhabar, she shared the plans she hopes to accomplish during her term.\nHer priority is to strengthen the school\u2019s technological capacity so that students become more technologically skilled. Second, she plans to introduce more optional subjects. She also aims to prioritise sports. Lastly, she intends to improve students\u2019 public speaking skills and further enhance the quality of the robotics program.\n\u201cMy goal is to make Durbar High School a place where students are confident, skilled, and ready to compete anywhere, not just in exams, but in life,\u201d says Paudel.", "url": "https://english.onlinekhabar.com/principal-sharada-kumari-paudel.html", "scraped_at": "2026-01-28T16:47:22.874670"}

{"title": "Know what are yomaris and learn how to cook them on your own", "content": "Considered one of the signature dishes of theNewa community, yomari is arguably a local invention that is both sweet and healthy. On the full moon day of Thinlaa: (the second month of Nepal Sambat) or Marga Shukla Paksha, the Newa community celebrates Yomari Punhi, where primarily the households make yomari of various shapes and sizes. The day is also celebrated asJyapuDiwas or Dhanya Purnima. Meanwhile, the Kirant community celebrates it as Udhauli.\nIt is said yomari was first made by a Newa couple working in the field of Panauti. Since rice was the prime harvest, the couple decided to use the harvest and make yomari out of it. Also, since it was winter, they filled it withchaku(molasses) to increase body heat. As a part of the community, the couple also shared their harvest and yomari with the neighbours.\nThe signature shape of the yomari is also said to resemble the fig.\nAnother story is of Chhinnapatta Maiju and yomari, but this yomari is about the fig. According to a cultural expert and retired Nepal Bhasa professor at Tribhuvan University, Chunda Bajracharya, \u201cIn this folklore, we hear the story about two sisters. The elder is Chhinnapatta Maiju, who was disliked by her mother. She had a goat as her friend. Her mother killed her beloved goat and Chhinnapatta took the bones out and buried them in the ground. It is said a fig\u00a0tree grew out of there and she used to spend more time there.\u201d\nShe continues, \u201cOne day when she was up in the tree, lakhe and lasi: (a demon couple) came there and tricked her into bringing the fig down to them. Chinnapatta got kidnapped and then was taken to their abode. The demon couple directed her to make roti (flatbread) for them. While in the kitchen, a mouse came to Chinnapatta and asked for roti. The mouse, in return for the roti, warned her that the demon couple were planning to eat her, so she better run with all the jewels they had stored. Chinnapatta Maiju adhered to it and went home with the jewels.\u201d\n\u201cSeeing her coming back with the jewels, the mother questioned her on what happened. After Chinnapatta briefed them, the mother directed her younger daughter to get kidnapped and get more jewels from the couple. She did, but she ignored the mouse unlike her sister and failed to get the warning. The demon couple then slept with the girl in between and ate her.\u201d\nAs an act of gratitude for the good harvest, it is a custom for the people to offer yomari to the gods and goddesses. It can be in any shape or size; more common are the signature shape of the yomari while others also make them in the shape of gods and goddesses.\nAs the day is celebrated in winter, people also follow the tradition of sitting in front of makal (traditional firepots) to keep themselves warm. \u201cMany also eat roasted eggs, garlic, and potatoes while sitting around the fire. However, the tradition is rarely seen nowadays,\u201d Bajracharya laments.\nChildren also go around to ask for yomari where the households share their fortune by giving it back to the community. Charity on the day is also very common, she adds.\nOther tradition includes guru puja (worshipping teachers) where people worship books and their teachers.\nChef Santosh Sah made yomari famous in the international cooking show Masterchef UK 2020. Looking at that, many are inclining towards tasting this local delicacy. With its newfound fame and the local festival in mind, here is how you can make yomari and enjoy this tasty delicacy at your own home:\nYou need a bowl of rice flour. You also need boiled water to make the dough.\nBoil water in a pot. Then, put the hot water in the rice flour, and mix them together. Knead the mixture and make it into a dough. [You have to be careful as the mixture can be hot to touch].\nWhen the dough is ready, wrap the dough in a cotton cloth. Leave it aside for half an hour or overnight.\nIn a pan or a pot, put water and chaku. With heat, the chaku turns into liquid. The mixture should be consistent and thick but runny. Mix black sesame seeds and powder into the pan, and mix all. Add cinnamon or cardamom for taste. Put it aside to cool down.\nMix a bit of water and make it a paste. In the paste, mix coconut, sugar, and almonds. Add cinnamon or cardamom for taste. And put it aside to cool down.\nPut oil on the palm. Take a dollop of the dough into your hands and give it the shape. Start on one side, roll the dough between your palms for an elongated tail or lower half of the yomari. On the top, poke a hole. With your index finger slowly start pressing and rolling the dough in your palms. Make the base like a vessel to put your fillings.\nPut a spoon of your fillings and cover the opening by slowly pressing the opening with your hands. Give shape to the top any way you like it.\nContinue the process to make as many yomari as you want.\nThe way you make yomari is just like making momos. So, you can use the same pot you would use to make momos.\nPut the water to boil.\nOil the pot base before putting in the yomari. Make sure there are gaps for the yomari so that they do not stick.\nWhen the water boils, keep the base on top of that to make yomari.\nCook it for 10 to 12 minutes.\nTake the hot yomari into a plate and serve it.\nGarnish it with chopped almonds or chocolate syrup or any ingredient you would like before serving.\nFrom thearchive.", "url": "https://english.onlinekhabar.com/yomari-punhi-newa-festival-nepal.html", "scraped_at": "2026-01-28T16:47:31.070854"}
{"title": "With foreign talent and rising crowds, Nepal\u2019s cricket finds fresh energy", "content": "Right now in Nepal, as the clock strikes either 11 am or 4 pm, thousands of people get excited about the same thing, watching theNepal Premier League. Cricket, over the past few years, has gained immense popularity among Nepalis as the national team has achieved major milestones, such as playing in the World Cup and retaining ODI status. The cricket fraternity of Nepal has accomplished feats that other sports communities in the country still dream of.\nThe second edition of the NPL features matches under floodlights and allows spectators to watch from the parapet, both happening for the first time in Nepal\u2019s cricketing history, marking yet another milestone.\nIn a country currently experiencing intense political tension, cricket has, to some extent, created an environment where people can share moments of happiness.\nWhile this league continues to draw attention from thousands around the world, its significance for Nepal\u2019s cricket fraternity, along with its challenges and future, remains an important topic of discussion.\nFormer captain of Nepal\u2019s national cricket team, Gyanendra Malla, says that such leagues would first strengthen the status of the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), the cricket governing body of Nepal.\n\u201cOnce CAN becomes strong, a lot of positive changes will automatically occur in the cricket fraternity,\u201d says Malla, who is also the coach of Karnali Yaks, one of the NPL franchise teams.\nHe further adds that such a league will open avenues to international leagues for Nepali cricketers in the coming days.\nEach team in the NPL includes eight foreign players. In the first edition of the NPL, Nepali players had the opportunity to play with or against big names such as Shikhar Dhawan, Martin Guptill, Ravi Bopara, and James Neesham. Similarly, big names in the second edition include Jason Roy and Sohail Tanvir, Faf du Plessis and others.\n\u201cGaining and sharing experiences with foreign coaches and cricketers will naturally help in the skill development of our players,\u201d says Malla.\nIn theeight-decade-long cricketing historyof Nepal, this is the first time that such a large franchise cricket league has been organised by CAN.\nThe NPL also held a talent hunt where each team opened a camp and selected the best players, one included in the main squad and others in the development squad, allowing them to train with the team.\n\u201cExploring new domestic players from different parts of the country who could contribute to the future of Nepal\u2019s national team is another significant step taken by the NPL,\u201d says CAN spokesperson Chhumbi Lama.\nEchoing Malla, Lama says that sharing the same dressing room and playing alongside players from various backgrounds will further enhance the skills of Nepali players.\nBoth Malla and Lama say that, in addition to skill development and making the cricket sector vibrant, leagues like the NPL also help boost tourism and Nepal\u2019s economy.\nNational cricket player Gulshan Jha says that the NPL has become a great learning platform for domestic players.\n\u201cBesides the technical aspects, playing with players from different countries also helps mentally. It allows us to understand other players\u2019 approaches to the game,\u201d says Jha, who currently plays for Karnali Yaks.\nAccording to CAN, on average, around 6,000 spectators watch the NPL live at the TU International Cricket Ground. On Saturdays, the tickets get sold out, meaning 12,000 spectators watch the NPL live at the TU International Cricket Ground. Ticket prices range from Rs 500 to 2,000.Reportedly, the first edition of the NPL was viewed live by around 130,000 to 135,000 spectators.\nWhile the league is getting \u201cbigger and better,\u201d it also faces challenges.\nAccording to the concerned authorities, the first and biggest challenge in hosting the NPL is infrastructure.\n\u201cAlthough we now have floodlights and well-managed parapets, we still need better infrastructure,\u201d Lama says. \u201cSeeing the growth of Nepali cricket, I am hopeful that we will get good infrastructure very soon.\u201d\nFor the improvement of the league in the future, Malla suggests that the next edition be held in better weather conditions.\n\u201cIn the present weather, the pitch condition is not as good as it should be,\u201d he says. \u201cBetter pitch conditions would make the matches even more interesting.\u201d\nHe adds that the league would reach another level if it received full sanction from the ICC.", "url": "https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepals-cricket-finds-fresh-energy.html", "scraped_at": "2026-01-28T16:47:34.249318"}

The bureau\u2019s chief,  Manoj K.C., an Additional Inspector General of police, informed that the so-called rescues were fabricated.\n\u201cEven charter flights were shown as rescues to obtain insurance payments,\u201d K.C. says. \u201cThese were not genuine rescues but fake ones.\u201d\nInvestigators said regular flights were also falsely labelled as rescue operations, with fabricated rescue schedules and passenger records submitted to support insurance claims.\nAccording to officials, in some cases, multiple tourists travelling on a single charter flight were billed as having been rescued separately and at different times, a practice known as \u201csingle flight, multiple billing.\u201d\nAs per the investigation, trekking tourists returning along the same route after completing their journeys were persuaded to fly back to Kathmandu on chartered helicopters, which were later presented as emergency evacuations.\nThe CIB said it had received multiple complaints in recent years, including one as recently as December 16, 2024, and another on September 28, 2025. The Ministry of Home Affairs also formally requested an investigation into fake rescues earlier this winter.\nAuthorities allege that the scheme involved illegal collusion among trekking and travel companies, helicopter rescue firms, hospitals and tourist guides, primarily targeting foreign trekkers.\nThe CIB is currently investigating fake rescues carried out since 2022.\nAfter conducting a separate investigation over the past two and a half months, including during public holidays, the CIB announced the arrest of six people accused of orchestrating the fraud.\nThose arrested include Jayaram Rimal, owner of Mountain Rescue Service Pvt. Ltd., and its manager, Bibek Pandey, Rabindra Adhikari, owner of Nepal Charter Service, and operations manager Bibek Raj Thapaliya, and Mukti Pandey, owner of Everest Experience and Assistance Pvt. Ltd., along with its manager, Subash K.C.\nAll six are affiliated with three companies that investigators say were involved in at least 317 fake rescues.\nAccording to the CIB, the Mountain Rescue Service reported evacuating 1,248 tourists between 2022 and 2025. Of those, 171 were found to be fraudulent, resulting in insurance claims totalling $10.31 million.\nNepal Charter Service reported 417 rescues, of which 75 were found to be fake, with insurance payouts of approximately $8.23 million.\nEverest Experience and Assistance reported 601 rescues, including 71 fraudulent cases, with insurance claims amounting to $1.15 million.\nIn total, investigators estimate that the three companies obtained $19.69 million through fake rescue claims.\n\u201cThis is preliminary data, and the figures could increase,\u201d a CIB investigation officer says toOnlinekhabar.\nAs fake rescues increased, insurance companies covering foreign trekkers began suspending premium payments, according to CIB officials.\nAt least three insurance companies have completely halted premium payments, citing mounting losses from fraudulent claims. Some claims submitted by rescue companies were also rejected outright.\nThe six suspects are being investigated under multiple provisions of Nepal\u2019s criminal code, including organised crime, forgery, fraud and offences against the state.\nInvestigators said the case falls under Section 51 of the Criminal Code, which prohibits acts detrimental to national interest, as well as Section 249 (fraud), Section 253 (illegal financial gain), and Section 276 (document-related offenses).\nAuthorities allege that fake medical reports and helicopter invoices were forged, fraudulent insurance bills were submitted, and tourists were falsely warned of life-threatening altitude sickness to justify evacuations, damaging Nepal\u2019s international reputation in the process.\nThe case is being treated as an organised crime involving collusion among trekking agencies, hospitals and helicopter companies. Money laundering charges may also apply.\nForeign tourists travelling to Nepal typically purchase insurance before trekking in high-altitude regions. Investigators say travel agencies first verified the tourists\u2019 insurance policies before planning fake rescues.\nOnce in the mountains, guides allegedly exaggerated minor symptoms commonly associated with altitude, pressuring tourists into helicopter evacuations that were medically unnecessary.\nIn many cases, officials said, tourists would recover simply by descending to a lower altitude, yet were still flown to Kathmandu and taken to specific hospitals favoured by the rescue operators.\nRescue companies and hospitals then submitted separate or lump-sum bills to insurance providers.\nWhile the current investigation covers cases since 2022, authorities acknowledged that fake rescues had been reported as early as 2018. However, the lack of documentation has made older cases difficult to prosecute.\nIn 2017, a travel assistance firm reported that nearly 35 percent of rescues were fraudulent. That same year, reports emerged of trekkers being deliberately made ill through food contamination to trigger evacuations and earn commissions.\nA government investigation committee formed in 2018 recommended further police inquiry and led to the introduction of new rescue monitoring guidelines. But officials say the absence of records has hindered retrospective investigations.\nThe CIB warned that fake rescues risk tarnishing Nepal\u2019s international image and could eventually make the country a \u201cno-go destination\u201d for tourists.\nOfficials also cautioned that fraudulent evacuations could delay or obstruct genuine rescue operations, potentially putting lives at risk.", "url": "https://english.onlinekhabar.com/fake-helicopter-rescues-in-nepal.html", "scraped_at": "2026-01-28T16:47:42.029265"}

{"title": "Nepal\u2019s Election: Something is cooking", "content": "Nepal is at a political crossroads. The recent Gen-Z protests shook the country to its core, toppling a sitting government in just 48 hours. This was not just street politics; it was a loud signal of public frustration, frustration with corruption, slow governance, and political stagnation. But it\u2019s not only about what\u2019s happening inside Nepal.\nRegional geopolitics and international influence have quietly but powerfully shaped the currents behind these protests. Even after a new government was formed and investigation committees were set up to look into the September 8\u20139 shootings and vandalism, uncertainty persists.\nAmid all the chaos, one thing has become clear- Nepal must go to the election. The bigger question now is not if but how\u2014what kind of political order will emerge, and who will lead it?\nYoung people around the world are challenging politics from Sri Lanka to Bangladesh; they are demanding accountability and space in decision-making. Nepal is no different. The protests started after a temporary social media ban, layered on years of frustration with corruption and slow political reforms.\nWhat made these protests stand out was their energy, but also their risks. School children in uniform joined, raising ethical and legal questions, as Nepali law forbids children from participating in political activity. Were they manipulated, or were they genuinely expressing frustration? The truth may never be fully known.\nWhen the protesters entered restricted zones, things turned violent. Lives were lost. Initially, security forces were restrained, but later actions were widely criticised as excessive. The attacks on state institutions-the legislature, judiciary, and executive showed that this was more than a protest.\nEven before the protests, Nepal\u2019s political landscape was shifting. New actors were emerging. The Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), led by Rabi Lamichhane, and independent figures like Kathmandu Mayor Balendra (Balen) Shah and Dharan Mayor Harka Sampang had started capturing public imagination.\nGlobally, populism thrives in moments like this. Leaders such as Donald Trump or Volodymyr Zelenskyy show that people respond to authenticity and decisive action, even if the leader lacks traditional experience. Yet scholars caution about its dangers. As political theorist Jan\u2011Werner M\u00fcller notes- \u201cThe danger to democracies today is not some comprehensive ideology that systematically denies democratic ideals. The danger is populism\u2014a degraded form of democracy that promises to make good on democracy\u2019s highest ideals.\u201d\nNepal\u2019s youth-heavy electorate seems to favour this same style; direct, hands-on leadership rather than long-established party hierarchies. For old parties, this is an existential challenge.\nThe protests and political shifts have also drawn attention to Nepal\u2019s southern neighbour. Officially, non-interference is emphasised, but public perception is different. Many observers believe the popularity of Kathmandu Mayor Balendra (Balen) Shah and the organisational strength of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) have grown in ways that may align with external interests.\nBalen\u2019s rising projection against CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli is especially symbolic. Many view this as a backlash against Oli\u2019s nationalist stance, most visibly reflected in the publication of Nepal\u2019s new political map and, for some, even as an attempt to curtail his political trajectory.\nInterestingly, Balen, who earlier downplayed his connections with Madhesh, is now increasingly presenting himself as a dhartiputra of Madhesh, mobilising Madheshi political sentiment. This rapid shift, along with his projection as a potential prime ministerial candidate, has raised questions about how organic this political transformation truly is. Public debate increasingly points to the possible role of the southern neighbour in facilitating this alignment. Whether organic or encouraged, this shift has undeniably fueled political speculation.\nAs political commentator C.K. Lal cautions, \u201cPopulism in Nepal risks replacing institutions with personalities, making the state more vulnerable to external influence.\u201d In Nepal\u2019s fragile democracy, perception alone is already shaping voter behaviour.\nPopulism often comes at a cost. Globally, it tends to sideline gender equality, proportional representation, and minority rights and Nepal is no exception. Current federal election data shows male candidates outnumber female candidates nearly eight to one.\nFrom a feminist perspective, this imbalance is not accidental. As feminist political theorist Anne Phillips argues, \u201cWhen politics is reduced to personality and charisma, women are the first to be pushed out.\u201d Populist politics, which often glorifies strong, individual leaders, tends to marginalise collective struggles for equality and representation.\nThis trend threatens hard-won constitutional gains. If elections prioritise popularity over institutions and safeguards, Nepal risks undoing years of progress in federalism, inclusion, and representative democracy\u2014progress achieved largely through sustained feminist and social justice movements rather than populist appeal.\nNepal\u2019s elections are more than a contest between old and new parties. They are a test: will democratic change strengthen institutions, or weaken them? Old parties are regrouping. New forces are mobilising. Young voters are energised. Regional geopolitics looms large. Something is cooking in Nepal\u2019s politics, but whether it strengthens democracy depends on leadership.\nThe new generation of leaders is energetic and popular, but many lack parliamentary experience. Can young leaders without legislative or executive experience navigate complex geopolitics, manage relations with neighbouring powers, and safeguard national interests?\nIn a parliamentary democracy, a prime minister without parliamentary experience faces extraordinary challenges balancing governance and diplomacy.\nYet this is also an opportunity. Nepal can embrace political change without sacrificing democratic substance. Federalism, proportional representation, gender equality, and inclusion must remain intact. History shows that populist waves often erode these very pillars first.\nThe real test is not just who comes to power, but whether Nepal\u2019s democracy emerges stronger, inclusive, accountable, and resilient or louder, flashier, and fragile. Leadership, maturity, and respect for institutions will determine if the country can navigate these turbulent times and transform unrest into constructive change.\n", "url": "https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepals-election-something-is-cooking.html", "scraped_at": "2026-01-28T16:47:48.892079"}

{"title": "Gen Z protest shook the state, but what comes next?", "content": "TheGen Z protestin Nepal declared that the voices of citizens would not be silenced, and it is the state\u2019s fundamental duty to respect them. It institutionalised the voices of Gen Z youth and brought the expectations of citizens to the forefront. The protest credited to the Gen Z age group was a collective citizen frustration, something that wasn\u2019t resisted by this generation. A generation criticised for remaining on screen and lacking civic consciousness came out in the streets with information and technology, with eyes seeking accountability, transparency and reflection from the government. A generation of first-time protesters took to the streets with only one thing on their mind: it\u2019s high time we stop resisting and start reacting. The nation looked in awe at them, the protest in no time made the state pause, all state power supposedly in a state of vacuum. While the spontaneity and determination are something to be proud of, the results of September 8 & 9 were unprecedented.\nAs the chants faded and the fire started dying, the aftermath made us stand before an uncomfortable and undeniable truth: what next? We are now in the quiet period, one where our discomfort and vulnerability of civic consciousness has entered the frame. A period of reflection where we are surrounded by the real question. What did we achieve? What changed? And what didn\u2019t change? Have we transitioned towards the governance we demanded, or is it just a cosmetic change? Or is it a political plot for heroes to enter?\nWith all these questions around us, we are heading towards an election with the belief that it will bring an end to the former kleptocratic and kakistocratic system with inclusivity and social well-being at its heart.\u00a0 As the warm-up for elections has begun, it is significant for both revolutionaries and reformists and for old and new ones. As citizens, we stand at this crossroad of hope and scepticism. There are heroes in the political frame claiming the patronage of revolution. The charisma and energy that\u2019s around them gives hope and are necessary for building a popular consciousness. But the protest was never imagined for heroes; it only demanded accountability and transparency. Now heading into a peaceful and sustainable transition, we need to figure out how and who takes the objective of the protest forward. We didn\u2019t recalibrate the political situation of our country to hand over the state authority; we never imagined different metrics of accountability and transparency for anyone.\nThis is a historical tendency post-revolution, visibly seen after the French Revolution, the rise of Maximilien Robespierre in France after the abolishment monarchy is classic. Robespierre, a symbol of the revolution and the hero who helped knock down the old system, became a liability in no time. Why couldn\u2019t a hero of the people deliver instant stability and perfect leadership? It wasn\u2019t Robespierre at fault, but the sudden immunity of citizens from accountability and uncontrolled power corrupted him at heart. His principles and virtue were suspended by his power, his disillusion that the mandates of the revolution and his self-righteousness soon troubled his legacy. In no time, Robespierre became a cosmetic face with the same narcissism and power hunger as the king. The love for heroes and charismatic leadership is not hidden historically in Nepal, with episodic heroes rising to national politics in every decade. This fatalistic tendency is very well reflected in Nepal, as we are moving forward, and we are suspending collective ownership of the protest itself. The accountability and transparency that we demanded from the old system are being toned down for the heroes who have come forward. Heroes or villains, new or old, our standards and expectations shouldn\u2019t be based on double standards. We don\u2019t have the liberty to settle on the bare minimum at this critical juncture. As citizens, this double standard towards the heroes and prioritisation of heroics in political leaders after each transition is fatal. The faces that rise after revolution, despite their importance, should not remain heroes post-revolution, as the situation demands them to be one of us who is accountable and seeks accountability and not be a hero forever. Heroes are bold, idealistic and charismatic but also mysterious and out of reach of the general public. This divinity, mysteriousness and out of reach of leaders, politicians and monarchs is what motivates protests and revolution from France to Nepal.\nThe Gen Z revolution that stepped up in a similar nuance recalibrated our political situation now, with our double standards, heroic idolising gives a clear message that we have not reached the ideal point. It\u2019s better to assume this transition period as a beginning because we have to reflect back and rebuild. The achievements of this protest are engagement, awareness, and questioning for accountability. Our achievements are not limited to waves of faces, ideologies and heroics. This kind of wave of heroism is episodic in Nepal, so instead of running after the wave, we need to institutionalise the habit of questioning and relentlessly demanding accountability from each and everyone.The sustainability and results of our generational uprising will only be visible once we have a single standard for accountability for everyone. The day you make gods and heroes out of politicians, that\u2019s the day you lose your agency as the sovereign. Let\u2019s not get lost in the transition for searching heroes because \u2018not all heroes wear capes and\u00a0 not all post-revolutionary cape wearers are heroes\u2019", "url": "https://english.onlinekhabar.com/gen-z-protest-whats-next.html", "scraped_at": "2026-01-28T16:48:05.980773"}

People who seek the Milarepa pilgrimage and follow the footsteps of Milarepa pay homage and sit for meditation in this miraculous land. Such a vibrating Himalayan town welcomes travellers around the globe for exploration and spirituality.\nWe met a friendly Lama at the upper Monastery, named Thinley Lama, while hiking towards Sephuk Cave. He showed us around the monastery, the Milarepa footprint, explained about the meditation around the Caves in Lapchi, and much more. Similarly, we had the opportunity to meet Ngodup and Rinpoche Dhundrup.\nLapchi has a small Himalayan settlement, which is a nomadic settlement that entirely shifts to the lower land in winter. Overlooking the cliff, there are several huts, where yogis meditate, isolated from human communication.\nNot only spiritual abundance, but Lapchi offers delightful Himalayan views, hills, and cascading waterfalls. The surroundings are so pristine that one cannot stand without adoration.\nAccording to Rinpoche, some devotees meditate in the caves of Lapchi for three years, three months, three weeks, three days, three hours, and three seconds. You can take the meditation classes there that guide you for meditation in isolation.\nOne of the most famous Tibetan yogis, poets, singers, and saints, Jetsun Milarepa, is a legendary figure who lived around 1052-1135. Milarepa had a struggling childhood, learned black magic, and took revenge, causing deaths. He was crushed by guilt and decided to become a saint in remorse.\nHe went to Marpa, the translator, and still struggled a lot there, and finally learnt deep meditation practices. His life turned a new page and started a further journey as a wandering hermit. He went to the Himalayas, meditated, and attained enlightenment in a single lifetime, which is a great achievement. His famous song, The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa, is still globally renowned.\nThere are abundant attractions in Lapchi. Here are some attractions and their distance from the Lapchi Monastery. They are as follows:\nYou will get a public bus every day to Lamabagar from Kathmandu (early in the morning). It\u2019s better to take your own 4WD Jeep from Kathmandu, so that you can stretch 22 km more from Lamabagar.\nIf you drive to Lamabagar by public bus, your trek starts from there. If you are there by private vehicle, you can start the trek from Thangchhemu.\nPermits are required for foreign trekkers. You can get their arrangement from the government-registered trekking agency of Nepal.\nThey depend on how you are travelling. Food is available on the way, but you should reach a certain point. You can get good food and accommodation at Lamabagar (not luxurious), Lumnang, and Lapchi. It is said that Lumnang remains closed in the summertime, so you should know this beforehand.\nHowever, in Lapchi, you will get food and accommodation in the monastery.

On digital platforms, too, candidates have been strengthening their presence with the same aim.\nOne critical element, however, is missing: none of the political parties has released a manifesto. A manifesto is among the most important tools in an election, offering voters a clear basis on which to judge candidates and parties.

Be accountable to the people and publish your manifesto.\u201d\nOnline criticism has continued to grow, though political parties appear largely unresponsive. Writer Srijana Pokhrelnotedin a recent social media post that more than a dozen candidates contesting the election are her Facebook friends, representing different parties. She said she reviewed each of their profiles but did not find a single candidate who had pinned their party\u2019s manifesto.\nPokhrel also criticised candidates who ask voters to judge them by their records, arguing that such records are often \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d At the same time, she questioned candidates with no political track record, asking whether they expect voters to support them based solely on an introductory video. \u201cThis is an election, not a beauty pageant,\u201d she wrote.\nThe Nepali Congress, for its part, says it is still in the preliminary phase of drafting its manifesto.\n\u201cWe are still at an initial stage and are consulting experts from different sectors,\u201d says Pratap Paudel, political adviser to Gagan Thapa, the party\u2019s president.\nPaudel says the manifesto had not been delayed, adding that election-related activities already underway may have created the perception that its release was overdue. \u201cIn fact, manifestos are usually announced only about a month before the election,\u201d he said. He added that Thapa is currently campaigning in Sarlahi and that a party meeting will decide the date of publication after his return.\nThapa is leading the manifesto drafting process for the Nepali Congress.\nUnlike the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML says it is in the final stage of preparing its manifesto.\n\u201cWe are almost ready to publish it,\u201d says Min Bahadur Shahi, head of the party\u2019s publicity department.\nShahi said a few issues still required internal discussion before the manifesto could be released.\n\u201cWe are trying to publish it as soon as possible,\u201d he added.\nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party has informed that it plans to release its manifesto on February 13.\n\u201cWe are reviewing the draft and compiling suggestions and findings from provincial consultations and field studies,\u201d says Manish Jha, the party\u2019s spokesman.\nThe manifesto is being drafted under the leadership of Swarnim Wagle, the party\u2019s vice chairman. Jha said that because candidate nominations were filed 45 days ahead of the election, compared with 17 days in previous cycles, many people felt the manifesto announcement was overdue.\nKrantishikha Dhital, a central committee member of RSP actively involved in drafting the manifesto, said the party would release practical and achievable pledges rather than grand, unrealistic promises.\n\u201cWe are not preparing impossible or irresponsible declarations. The manifesto is being drafted in a way that directly addresses the concerns of young people,\u201d says Dhital. \u201cWe will come forward soon with proposals that reflect the public\u2019s expectations. Our focus will be on education, health care, employment and capital formation.\u201d\nWith just over five weeks remaining before voters go to the polls, the absence of manifestos has left many unsure how to compare candidates beyond personalities and past affiliations, raising broader questions about accountability and policy-driven debate in the campaign\u2019s final stretch.\nParty leaders also acknowledge that delays in releasing the manifesto could make it more difficult for voters to compare candidates.", "url": "https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepals-election-manifestos-absent.html", "scraped_at": "2026-02-07T11:00:14.729387"}
{"title": "Meet Sharda Kumari Paudel, first female principal of Nepal\u2019s oldest school", "content": "Following an intensely complex political period, Nepal this year appointed its first woman prime minister, a historic milestone. While the appointment of Sushila Karki as the country\u2019s first female prime minister has drawn global attention, another appointment within Nepal has received far less discussion despite its significance.Durbar High School, also known as Bhanu Secondary School, the first school in Nepal, has appointed its first female principal, 172 years after its establishment.\nOn November 20, Sharda Kumari Paudel was appointed principal of Durbar High School. Previously, she had been serving as the school\u2019s acting principal.\nBeing promoted from acting principal to principal, Paudel says she now feels more confident, responsible, and challenged.\nShe was appointed through an open competition among three contenders, in which she was the only female candidate.\nEstablished in 1854, Durbar High School took a long time to appoint a female principal. In this context, Paudel notes that in the past, women rarely entered the teaching profession, and those who did were mostly limited to teaching at the primary level.\n\u201cWomen in the past were confined to family life due to societal structures, which limited the time they could devote to their professional development,\u201d says Paudel. \u201cAs a result, it took a long time for women in almost every sector to reach higher positions, and Durbar High School is no exception.\u201d\nHowever, Paudel considers herself fortunate, as it was her father who inspired her to become a teacher and pursue a career in the profession.\n\u201cMy father always motivated me to serve society, and as a result, I chose to become a teacher,\u201d she says.\nBorn in Syangja in western Nepal, Paudel joined the teaching profession in 2004. Her first posting was at Mahendra Rastriya Secondary School in Baluwatar, where she taught health education for 10 years. In 2014, she joined Durbar High School as a permanent secondary-level teacher, teaching economics.\nIn 2019, she was appointed assistant principal of the school. At that time, Durbar High School had only 71 students. In 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, she was appointed principal with limited responsibilities. Under her leadership, the school began conducting virtual classes. Despite the challenges, the school also focused on strengthening extracurricular activities. It organised a national essay competition on the impact of COVID-19 and established a robotics lab.\nDurbar High School became the first government school in Nepal to introduce robotics classes. Students from the robotics program went on to win several competitions and participate in international events outside Nepal. Meanwhile, the school, severely damaged by the devastating 2015 earthquake, completed its renovation. In collaboration with Kathmandu Metropolitan City, smart boards were also installed in classrooms. After physical classes resumed, the number of students increased to 350.\nAs the quality of education improved, Durbar High School began attracting public attention. Even parents who had been sending their children to private schools started enrolling them at Durbar High School, one of the rarest shifts seen in Nepal\u2019s education sector.\nSimilarly, under Paudel\u2019s leadership, the school\u2019s canteen and security systems improved. Currently, the school has 1,095 students. Managing such a large number of students has become one of Paudel\u2019s major challenges as principal.\nThe challenge is compounded by the fact that Sanskrit Secondary School, which has around 900 students, is also operating within the Durbar High School building.\n\u201cAs two different institutions run in the same building, conflicts sometimes arise among students and teachers, and in such cases I have to be especially sensitive,\u201d says Paudel.\nDue to overcrowding, the school is compelled to run tiffin breaks multiple times, which often causes disturbances. Efforts are underway to address this challenge, she adds.\nWhile the number of students continues to grow each year, the school\u2019s resources remain limited. However, with support from guardians, the school has managed to recruit additional staff.\nTo prevent a shortage of teachers, the school has recently introduced the concept of a \u201cTeachers Bank.\u201d The Teachers Bank serves as a backup pool of teachers. For instance, if a teacher is unable to attend classes for a week or longer, the school can reach out to teachers listed in the Teachers Bank. The school has also publicly advertised this initiative and invited interested individuals to join. As a result, Paudel has received many inquiries and has been personally handling the process.\nPaudel\u2019s tenure as principal will be four years. Speaking toOnlinekhabar, she shared the plans she hopes to accomplish during her term.\nHer priority is to strengthen the school\u2019s technological capacity so that students become more technologically skilled. Second, she plans to introduce more optional subjects. She also aims to prioritise sports. Lastly, she intends to improve students\u2019 public speaking skills and further enhance the quality of the robotics program.\n\u201cMy goal is to make Durbar High School a place where students are confident, skilled, and ready to compete anywhere, not just in exams, but in life,\u201d says Paudel.", "url": "https://english.onlinekhabar.com/principal-sharada-kumari-paudel.html", "scraped_at": "2026-02-07T11:00:20.213636"}

Sapkota asserts that he is the first person in Nepal\u2019s history to do a bungee jump in a wheelchair.\nAmong the two, Sapkota jumped first from the 160-meter-high suspension bridge, and Dahal successfully followed soon after.\n\u201cIt was a historic leap, for the first time in Nepal, I did a bungee jump from a wheelchair,\u201d Sapkota says with excitement. \u201cThese activities are not just displays of personal courage. I want accessible tourism to grow in Nepal, and I want people with disabilities to participate equally in hiking, trekking, and adventure activities. That\u2019s why I keep taking part in new and challenging adventures, hoping my experience will inspire confidence, motivation, and courage in others with disabilities.\u201d\nDahal shares a similar experience. He toldOnlinekhabarthat the bungee jump was an enjoyable and memorable experience.\n\u201cI wanted to experience it for myself. But I also wanted my attempt to inspire others, which is why I jumped along with my wheelchair,\u201d Dahal says. \u201cThe bridge shook slightly, but the moment above the river,\u00a0 being the first to bungee in a wheelchair was unforgettable.\u201d\nShishir added, \u201cI had done such adventure activities before, but this time I wanted to inspire others with disabilities and hopefully shift society\u2019s perception of people with disabilities, which is why I did the bungee in a wheelchair.\u201d\nAfter suffering a spinal injury that left him bedridden and unable to move for a long time, Sapkota now travels on a disability-friendly scooter and wheelchair, becoming a strong voice for thousands of people with disabilities.\nSapkota has been participating in paragliding, zipline, swing, and other adventure activities for a long time.\nHe is not only an adventure enthusiast but also a committed advocate for inclusive tourism. Despite his disability, he serves as the secretary of the Jugal Tourism Promotion and Environment Conservation Forum Nepal, continuously lobbying for accessible tourism. He believes that making trails, routes, and services in Nepal\u2019s tourism sector accessible for people with disabilities must now be a mandatory agenda.\nDahal, who joined Sapkota in the bungee jump, has been living with spinal paralysis due to a motorcycle accident.\nHe has been using a wheelchair for four years. Dahal runs an agricultural nursery in Bhaktapur. Alongside the nursery, he also works as a graphic designer and social media manager, and holds leadership roles in various sports and entertainment-related organizations.", "url": "https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wheelchair-bungee-jump.html", "scraped_at": "2026-02-07T11:00:25.873801"}
{"title": "Know what are yomaris and learn how to cook them on your own", "content": "Considered one of the signature dishes of theNewa community, yomari is arguably a local invention that is both sweet and healthy. On the full moon day of Thinlaa: (the second month of Nepal Sambat) or Marga Shukla Paksha, the Newa community celebrates Yomari Punhi, where primarily the households make yomari of various shapes and sizes. The day is also celebrated asJyapuDiwas or Dhanya Purnima. Meanwhile, the Kirant community celebrates it as Udhauli.\nIt is said yomari was first made by a Newa couple working in the field of Panauti. Since rice was the prime harvest, the couple decided to use the harvest and make yomari out of it. Also, since it was winter, they filled it withchaku(molasses) to increase body heat. As a part of the community, the couple also shared their harvest and yomari with the neighbours.\nThe signature shape of the yomari is also said to resemble the fig.\nAnother story is of Chhinnapatta Maiju and yomari, but this yomari is about the fig. According to a cultural expert and retired Nepal Bhasa professor at Tribhuvan University, Chunda Bajracharya, \u201cIn this folklore, we hear the story about two sisters. The elder is Chhinnapatta Maiju, who was disliked by her mother. She had a goat as her friend. Her mother killed her beloved goat and Chhinnapatta took the bones out and buried them in the ground. It is said a fig\u00a0tree grew out of there and she used to spend more time there.\u201d\nShe continues, \u201cOne day when she was up in the tree, lakhe and lasi: (a demon couple) came there and tricked her into bringing the fig down to them. Chinnapatta got kidnapped and then was taken to their abode. The demon couple directed her to make roti (flatbread) for them. While in the kitchen, a mouse came to Chinnapatta and asked for roti. The mouse, in return for the roti, warned her that the demon couple were planning to eat her, so she better run with all the jewels they had stored. Chinnapatta Maiju adhered to it and went home with the jewels.\u201d\n\u201cSeeing her coming back with the jewels, the mother questioned her on what happened. After Chinnapatta briefed them, the mother directed her younger daughter to get kidnapped and get more jewels from the couple. She did, but she ignored the mouse unlike her sister and failed to get the warning. The demon couple then slept with the girl in between and ate her.\u201d\nAs an act of gratitude for the good harvest, it is a custom for the people to offer yomari to the gods and goddesses. It can be in any shape or size; more common are the signature shape of the yomari while others also make them in the shape of gods and goddesses.\nAs the day is celebrated in winter, people also follow the tradition of sitting in front of makal (traditional firepots) to keep themselves warm. \u201cMany also eat roasted eggs, garlic, and potatoes while sitting around the fire. However, the tradition is rarely seen nowadays,\u201d Bajracharya laments.\nChildren also go around to ask for yomari where the households share their fortune by giving it back to the community. Charity on the day is also very common, she adds.\nOther tradition includes guru puja (worshipping teachers) where people worship books and their teachers.\nChef Santosh Sah made yomari famous in the international cooking show Masterchef UK 2020. Looking at that, many are inclining towards tasting this local delicacy. With its newfound fame and the local festival in mind, here is how you can make yomari and enjoy this tasty delicacy at your own home:\nYou need a bowl of rice flour. You also need boiled water to make the dough.\nBoil water in a pot. Then, put the hot water in the rice flour, and mix them together. Knead the mixture and make it into a dough. [You have to be careful as the mixture can be hot to touch].\nWhen the dough is ready, wrap the dough in a cotton cloth. Leave it aside for half an hour or overnight.\nIn a pan or a pot, put water and chaku. With heat, the chaku turns into liquid. The mixture should be consistent and thick but runny. Mix black sesame seeds and powder into the pan, and mix all. Add cinnamon or cardamom for taste. Put it aside to cool down.\nMix a bit of water and make it a paste. In the paste, mix coconut, sugar, and almonds. Add cinnamon or cardamom for taste. And put it aside to cool down.\nPut oil on the palm. Take a dollop of the dough into your hands and give it the shape. Start on one side, roll the dough between your palms for an elongated tail or lower half of the yomari. On the top, poke a hole. With your index finger slowly start pressing and rolling the dough in your palms. Make the base like a vessel to put your fillings.\nPut a spoon of your fillings and cover the opening by slowly pressing the opening with your hands. Give shape to the top any way you like it.\nContinue the process to make as many yomari as you want.\nThe way you make yomari is just like making momos. So, you can use the same pot you would use to make momos.\nPut the water to boil.\nOil the pot base before putting in the yomari. Make sure there are gaps for the yomari so that they do not stick.\nWhen the water boils, keep the base on top of that to make yomari.\nCook it for 10 to 12 minutes.\nTake the hot yomari into a plate and serve it.\nGarnish it with chopped almonds or chocolate syrup or any ingredient you would like before serving.\nFrom thearchive.", "url": "https://english.onlinekhabar.com/yomari-punhi-newa-festival-nepal.html", "scraped_at": "2026-02-07T11:00:30.593685"}
{"title": "With foreign talent and rising crowds, Nepal\u2019s cricket finds fresh energy", "content": "Right now in Nepal, as the clock strikes either 11 am or 4 pm, thousands of people get excited about the same thing, watching theNepal Premier League. Cricket, over the past few years, has gained immense popularity among Nepalis as the national team has achieved major milestones, such as playing in the World Cup and retaining ODI status. The cricket fraternity of Nepal has accomplished feats that other sports communities in the country still dream of.\nThe second edition of the NPL features matches under floodlights and allows spectators to watch from the parapet, both happening for the first time in Nepal\u2019s cricketing history, marking yet another milestone.\nIn a country currently experiencing intense political tension, cricket has, to some extent, created an environment where people can share moments of happiness.\nWhile this league continues to draw attention from thousands around the world, its significance for Nepal\u2019s cricket fraternity, along with its challenges and future, remains an important topic of discussion.\nFormer captain of Nepal\u2019s national cricket team, Gyanendra Malla, says that such leagues would first strengthen the status of the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN), the cricket governing body of Nepal.\n\u201cOnce CAN becomes strong, a lot of positive changes will automatically occur in the cricket fraternity,\u201d says Malla, who is also the coach of Karnali Yaks, one of the NPL franchise teams.\nHe further adds that such a league will open avenues to international leagues for Nepali cricketers in the coming days.\nEach team in the NPL includes eight foreign players. In the first edition of the NPL, Nepali players had the opportunity to play with or against big names such as Shikhar Dhawan, Martin Guptill, Ravi Bopara, and James Neesham. Similarly, big names in the second edition include Jason Roy and Sohail Tanvir, Faf du Plessis and others.\n\u201cGaining and sharing experiences with foreign coaches and cricketers will naturally help in the skill development of our players,\u201d says Malla.\nIn theeight-decade-long cricketing historyof Nepal, this is the first time that such a large franchise cricket league has been organised by CAN.\nThe NPL also held a talent hunt where each team opened a camp and selected the best players, one included in the main squad and others in the development squad, allowing them to train with the team.\n\u201cExploring new domestic players from different parts of the country who could contribute to the future of Nepal\u2019s national team is another significant step taken by the NPL,\u201d says CAN spokesperson Chhumbi Lama.\nEchoing Malla, Lama says that sharing the same dressing room and playing alongside players from various backgrounds will further enhance the skills of Nepali players.\nBoth Malla and Lama say that, in addition to skill development and making the cricket sector vibrant, leagues like the NPL also help boost tourism and Nepal\u2019s economy.\nNational cricket player Gulshan Jha says that the NPL has become a great learning platform for domestic players.\n\u201cBesides the technical aspects, playing with players from different countries also helps mentally. It allows us to understand other players\u2019 approaches to the game,\u201d says Jha, who currently plays for Karnali Yaks.\nAccording to CAN, on average, around 6,000 spectators watch the NPL live at the TU International Cricket Ground. On Saturdays, the tickets get sold out, meaning 12,000 spectators watch the NPL live at the TU International Cricket Ground. Ticket prices range from Rs 500 to 2,000.Reportedly, the first edition of the NPL was viewed live by around 130,000 to 135,000 spectators.\nWhile the league is getting \u201cbigger and better,\u201d it also faces challenges.\nAccording to the concerned authorities, the first and biggest challenge in hosting the NPL is infrastructure.\n\u201cAlthough we now have floodlights and well-managed parapets, we still need better infrastructure,\u201d Lama says. \u201cSeeing the growth of Nepali cricket, I am hopeful that we will get good infrastructure very soon.\u201d\nFor the improvement of the league in the future, Malla suggests that the next edition be held in better weather conditions.\n\u201cIn the present weather, the pitch condition is not as good as it should be,\u201d he says. \u201cBetter pitch conditions would make the matches even more interesting.\u201d\nHe adds that the league would reach another level if it received full sanction from the ICC.", "url": "https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepals-cricket-finds-fresh-energy.html", "scraped_at": "2026-02-07T11:00:39.914552"}
